1. 1 to 3 to 12 delay in first 4 steps, 12 to 3 in last 4 steps
2. randomized *=1.1 to 1.4 speed change for 40>; 0.9 to 1.1 for 40<60; 0.8 to 0.9 for >60;
3. use log and sqrt of xh-abs(xexp) to measure for >60
4. relocate delay() to be before mouse movement and not after
5. count how much time has passed since last delay and add additional delay if needed
6. set delay to 4ms, periodically (every 13to15 movements) do 2ms delay with full speed 
7. randomize all this stuff
