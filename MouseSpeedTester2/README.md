mst2.exe was made to test mouse polling rate, simply launch the programm, press "B" on your keyboard, move your mouse a little then press "R". It's preferred that you already moving it before pressing "B" and only stop already after pressing "R".

The resulting text file that appears in the same folder named "record.txt" will show you how long was the pause between each movement, in milliseconds. Every new line is new move and time between them is marked "Ms:".

My mouse is Ritmix RMW-555 and the resulting file after testing it can be found in the folder under the name "Ritmix RMW-555.txt", after looking at it I concluded that my mouse's polling rate is 4 ms.
